# Part 1 / Courseinfo 

This is my submission for the Full Stack Open [Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) 2020, parts 1.b and 2.a.

This application is a page that shows information about courses.

## Learning focus

- React 
    - components
    - passing data with props
    - rendering collections
    - key-attribute
    - modules
    - JSX
- JavaScript
    - arrow functions
    - objects
    - destructuring
    - ``.map()`` and ``.reduce()``
    - basic debugging

## Notes

### Passing data with props
- data is passed as an object. I'd like to find a way to structure it so to avoid using a sequel of dots like ``data.part.piece.crumb``
    - turns out: **destructuring** can help with that

## Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Javascript follows ES6 specifications.

## Usage

First clone the project and navigate to ``courseinfo/``.

Then run:

```
npm start
```

Finally open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
