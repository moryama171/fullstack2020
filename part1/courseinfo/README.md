# Part 1 / Courseinfo 

This is my submission for the Full Stack Open [Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) 2020, part 1.b.

This application shows information about a course.

## Learning focus

- React components
- JSX
- passing data with props
- JS arrow functions
- JS objects
- basic debugging of JS

## Notes

### Passing data with props
- data is passed as an object. I'd like to find a way to structure it so to avoid using a sequel of dots like ``data.part.piece.crumb``

## Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Javascript follows [ES10](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html) specifications.

## Usage

First clone the project and navigate to ``courseinfo/``.

Then run:

```
npm start
```

Finally open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
