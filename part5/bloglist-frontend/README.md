# Part 5 / BlogList front end

This is my submission for the Full Stack Open [Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) 2020, part 5.

This is the front end for a blog list web application. Check out the [back end](https://github.com/moryama171/fullstack2020-part4).

The application allows users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet.

Check out the application. [COMING SOON]

## Learning focus

- login interface and service
- handle token storage and usage
- lifting the state up
- implement 'likes' functionality

## Notes

### Lifting state up
- from React [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html): *Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.*

## Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

First clone the project and navigate to ``bloglist-frontend/``.

Then run:

```
npm start
```

Finally open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view the app in the browser.


## Improvements and beyond
