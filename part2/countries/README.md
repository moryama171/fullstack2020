- JS `.filter()`

## Notes

## Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Javascript follows ES6 specifications.

## Usage

First clone the project and navigate to ``countries/``.

Then run:

```
npm start
```

Finally open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
